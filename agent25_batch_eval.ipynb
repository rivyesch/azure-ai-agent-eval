      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify the Context:** If your request is about viewing, not resetting, specifying that up front helps me avoid pulling in reset instructions.\n",

Falling back to using the original response: Ah, gotcha—you’re the one behind the scenes! In that case, here’s how you can help boost my retrieval accuracy from a system design perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **KB Article Structure & Tagging:**  \n",
      "   - Ensure articles use clear, unique headings for each user action (e.g., “View PIN,” “Reset PIN,” “Release Print Job”).\n",
      "   - Add relevant tags or metadata to articles for common user intents and synonyms (e.g., “find PIN,” “show PIN,” “printer PIN,” etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consistent Terminology:**  \n",
      "   - Use consistent language across articles and in UI labels, so my keyword matching doesn’t get tripped up by variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **FAQ or Quick Reference Sections:**  \n",
      "   - Include a summary or FAQ at the top of long articles with common user questions and direct links to the relevant section.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Search Optimization:**  \n",
      "   - If possible, implement or tune the search engine to prioritize headings, metadata, and in-article anchor terms over general content.\n",
      "   - Consider adding a synonym dictionary or intent mapping layer so that “view PIN,” “find PIN,” and “show PIN” all point to the same section.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Feedback Loop:**  \n",
      "   - Set up a way for me (or users) to flag when a search result didn’t match the intent, so you can refine article content or search logic over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Agent Prompt Tuning:**  \n",
      "   - Adjust my prompt or retrieval logic to favor sections of articles that match the action verb in the user’s query (e.g., “view” vs “reset”).\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: the more you can make the KB “machine-readable” and intent-friendly, the better I’ll be at matching user questions to the exact answer—even if the user is vague or uses everyday language. If you want, I can help review your KB structure or suggest tagging schemes based on common user intents!\n",

      "2. **Point Out When I Miss the Mark:** Like you did just now—if my answer doesn’t match what you know is in the guide, let me know. I can then adjust my search queries to be more precise and learn from the feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Share Document Structure or Headings:** If you’re familiar with the document layout (like “there’s a section called ‘Viewing your PIN’”), telling me that can help me target my search more accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify the Context:** If your request is about viewing, not resetting, specifying that up front helps me avoid pulling in reset instructions.\n",

In that case, here’s how you can help boost my retrieval accuracy from a system design perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **KB Article Structure & Tagging:**  \n",
      "   - Ensure articles use clear, unique headings for each user action (e.g., “View PIN,” “Reset PIN,” “Release Print Job”).\n",
      "   - Add relevant tags or metadata to articles for common user intents and synonyms (e.g., “find PIN,” “show PIN,” “printer PIN,” etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consistent Terminology:**  \n",
      "   - Use consistent language across articles and in UI labels, so my keyword matching doesn’t get tripped up by variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **FAQ or Quick Reference Sections:**  \n",
      "   - Include a summary or FAQ at the top of long articles with common user questions and direct links to the relevant section.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Search Optimization:**  \n",
      "   - If possible, implement or tune the search engine to prioritize headings, metadata, and in-article anchor terms over general content.\n",
      "   - Consider adding a synonym dictionary or intent mapping layer so that “view PIN,” “find PIN,” and “show PIN” all point to the same section.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Feedback Loop:**  \n",
      "   - Set up a way for me (or users) to flag when a search result didn’t match the intent, so you can refine article content or search logic over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Agent Prompt Tuning:**  \n",
      "   - Adjust my prompt or retrieval logic to favor sections of articles that match the action verb in the user’s query (e.g., “view” vs “reset”).\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: the more you can make the KB “machine-readable” and intent-friendly, the better I’ll be at matching user questions to the exact answer—even if the user is vague or uses everyday language. If you want, I can help review your KB structure or suggest tagging schemes based on common user intents!\n",
